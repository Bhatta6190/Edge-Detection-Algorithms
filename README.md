# Comparison of Few Edge Detection Algorithm

This is a very simple project that was done as a part of basic python course. The project involves writing three basic and mostly used Edge-detection-algorithms i.e. Canny Edge Detection Algorithm, Laplacian Edge Detection Algorithm and Robert Edge Detection Algorithm in computer vision from basic commands and comparing their performance on the basis of two metrices namely Peak signal to Noise ratio(PSNR) and Cosine Similarity.

All the steps involved in the processing are mentioned in the uploaded ipynb notebook.
