# **Comparison of Edge Detection Algorithms**

This project explores and compares three widely used edge-detection algorithms in computer vision:  
1. **Canny Edge Detection Algorithm**  
2. **Laplacian Edge Detection Algorithm**  
3. **Roberts Edge Detection Algorithm**  

The implementation is done using basic Python commands as part of a graduate-level introductory Python course.

## **Project Overview**

Edge detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, enabling the identification of object boundaries within images. This project involves:  
- Writing basic implementations of the three edge-detection algorithms.  
- Comparing the performance of these algorithms based on two metrics:  
  - **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR):** Measures the quality of the output image compared to the original.  
  - **Cosine Similarity:** Quantifies the similarity between the edges detected by the algorithms.  

### **Key Files**
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Details the step-by-step process, including algorithm implementation, evaluation metrics, and performance comparison.  
- **Presentation**: A summarized version of the work and results, ideal for a quick overview.
